# steam-multiple-account-login

With this little batch script you can easily change steam account. If you are more users on the same PC.

Windows magicly remembers, password for users and Steam Guard (2factor).
So after login with this script you no longer need password or Steam Guard to login into the PC.

If you logout in steam from an account you will have to re-enter password and 2factor for the account.
